### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/first-bad-version/discuss/341


```js
/*
 type TypIsBad = (version: number) => boolean
 */

/**
 * @param {TypIsBad} isBad 
 */
function firstBadVersion(isBad) {
  return (version) => {

    // binary search
    let min = 0;
    let max = version;

    while(min <=max) {

      const mid = Math.floor((min + max) / 2);

      if (isBad(mid)) { 
        max = mid - 1;
      } else { 
        min = mid + 1;
      };

    }
    return min <=version ? min : -1;  // if none found, return -1
  }
}
```

### Short story
This happens a few times with me. I don't understand the problem because they are sometimes directly related to a set of established algorithms. <br>
In this case, I found that people are solving it is using binary search. I knew a bit about binary search and understood more about this problem.

### Algorithm (Binary search) - 
1. You have a collection of items in a list. `list = [1,3,8,2,9]`
1. If not sorted then you sort them. `list = [1,2,3,8,9]`
1. You define a `min` and `max` variables. `min = 0`, `max = list.length`
1. You take middle value. `mid = list.length / 2`
1. You put a condition here and move either in the left direction or right direction of the middle. `min = middle + 1` or `max = middle - 1`
  1. Say, we want to find item n = 8, we will take middle which is 3 (with `Math.floor`).
  1. We check condition if(mid item from list < 8) then our item is must be after middle so we update `min = middle + 1` else we would have updated `max` to `max = middle - 1`
1. We continue this until `min <=max`. This is the terminator condition for the loop. This is because when you move in any direction either `min` will go beyond `max` value <br>
or `max` will go below `min` and this will terminate the loop.
1. We check if `min <= n` then the item is present in the list else not found.


| Time complexity | Space complexity |
|-----------------|------------------|
| O(log n)        |     O(1)         |

### Code overview - 
1.In the closure function, we first define our `min` and `max` values
1. We iterate until `min <= max` because we will iterate with half-half list till `min` or `max` break this condition
1. In while-loop, we calculate `mid` and also use `Math.floor` so that we get the integer for comparison
1. As we already have `isBad` utility, we pass our `mid` to check if it is bad or not
  1. It is mentioned that if we find any bad revision that means all revisions after that are bad
  1. If we find `mid` as bad revision that means either it is the first bad revision or somewhere between in bad revision list
    1. This means that we need to move from right to left
    1. We update the `max` variable for this. ` max = mid - 1;`
  1. If `mid` isn't a bad revision that means bad revisions are on right side
    1. We move to the right side using `min = mid + 1`
1. We iterate till one of the variables `min` or `max` break while-loop
1. Finally, in any case, we compare `min` with input
  1. If `min <= n` means 'n' is the first bad revision
  1. else there is no bad revision
