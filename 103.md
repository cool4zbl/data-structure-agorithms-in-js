```js
/**
 * @param {any} x
 * @return {number}
 */
function mySqrt(x) {
  
  /** === Using the Babylonian square-root algorithm ðŸ‘‡ === */
  // https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2016/05/16/babylonian-square-roots.html
  
  // special cases
  if(x == 0 || x == Infinity) return x;
  if(typeof x != 'number' || x == -Infinity || x < 0 || Number.isNaN(x) ) return NaN;
  
  // till what precision we want to find square root of a number.
  // doesn't matter in this case as we want to return only integer part.
  const precision = 0.00001;
  let guess = x / 2; // usually middle of 'x'
  
  let lastGuess = x / 2; // we compare the guess with last guess, we loop till we their difference crosses 'precision'

  while(true) {
    guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2; // Babylonian square-root algorithm
    if(lastGuess - guess <= precision) return Math.trunc(guess); // return only integer part
    lastGuess = guess; // update last guess with guess
  }
}
```

### Short story
I don't understand how can FAANG ask such questions. Definitely, scientists and mathematicians are there to come up with algorithms. <br />
As an engineer, my job is to implement them. Though it was a bit effortful task it wasn't something that I'm proud of (as I understood algorithm and just implemented it).

Okay, I'm stopping rant. That's just my feeling<sup>*</sup> right now.

### Algorithm - 

1. We first set accuracy (as `precision` const in code), to determine how much close do we want our square root result <br/>
Remember we don't need to go too deep as we just want integer (problem requirement) so up to 3-4 decimals is enough.
1. We first take an initial guess. This is usually a positive number and half of the input say, `guess = x / 2`
1. We need to improve our guess by applying formula - `guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2`. ðŸ‘ˆ This is Babylonian's main part
1. We repeat the process until our previous guess and current guess is equal to (or less than) precision <br/>
Because that shows that we are very near to getting value.
1. We take out the integer part using `Math.trunc` method
1. We also update `lastGuess` in each iteration to compare that in the next iteration

### Code overview - 
1. We first handle all the edge cases, I did when cases failed for them. (ðŸ’¡ Tip: Better to ask interviewer)
1. We set precision - `const precision = 0.00001;` Feel free to lower the value or go up to only 2-3 decimal places
1. For the first iteration, we initialize `guess` and `lastGuess` values by `x / 2`
1. We want to repeat the process until it reaches a point where `lastGuess` and `guess` is equal (or less than) `precision`.
1. We break while-loop inside rather than having a condition in a while-loop. It's a preference thing.
