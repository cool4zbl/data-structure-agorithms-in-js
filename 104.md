### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Traverse-DOM-level-by-level/discuss/814

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement | null} root
 * @return {HTMLElement[]}
 */
function flatten(root) {
  let result = [];
  if(!root) return result;

  const queue = [root];

  while(queue.length > 0) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    queue.push(...node.children);
    result.push(node);
  }

  return result;
}
```

### Short story
I tried hard to solve this problem and even all test cases were passed except 2.
I finally checked solutions and almost all had used the Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.

I decided to learn BFS before I post an explanation and solution in this repository.
I learned about it in the [egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-javascript) course by Kyle Shevlin.

### Algorithm
The DFS algorithm works for both Graph and Tree data structure. The crux of BFS is to use the Queue data structure (which is nothing but Array). 
In the tree, you visit children whereas in the Graph you visit neighbors.

1. We first enqueue (or push) the starting node into the array
1. We run a while-loop until the array is empty
1. We take out the first node from it and push its children/neighbors
1. After this, we push the node in the resulting array

The main logic is to push children/neighbors at the end of the queue array. This way it will cover breadth-first and then go 1 level down.

### Code overview
1. We create a `result` to push visited nodes (level by level)
1. If the input is falsy value then we return an empty array
1. We create a `queue` array to push nodes to be visited
    1. We begin by adding the `root` node. That's the point from where we want to begin visiting nodes
1. We run a while-loop till `queue.length > 0`
    1. This makes sure that we visit till there are no more children to be visited
1. In while-loop - 
    1. We dequeue node using `shift()` method and store it in the `node` variable
    1. As we want to visit the horizontal level, we take children of the `node` and push it in the `queue` so that after the existing level complete, we go down to the next level
    1. We push `node` in `result` array as we visited it and pushed its children (if any) in the `queue` array
1. Once the while-loop is over, we return the `result` array
