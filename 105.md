### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/find-the-first-duplicate-character-in-a-string/discuss/680

```js
/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @return {string | null}
 */
function firstDuplicate(str) {

  const duplicateEntry = []; // store string chars to find first duplicate

  for(let char of str) { 
    if(duplicateEntry.includes(char)) { // if the 'char' is already present means we have duplicate
      return char; // return the char, this will make sure we have first duplicate letter
    } else {
      duplicateEntry.push(char); // if 'char' is not present then add it
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Short story
I felt like this was simple.  Though I'm not sure if there is another way to optimize it. <br />
This is the first solution that came to my mind.

### Algorithm
1. Create an array to keep visited string characters
1. If the array includes the current character then return that char
1. That's the first repeated character
1. Else add current character in the array created in point 1
1. Return `null` if there is no duplicate character in the given string


### Code overview
1. We create an empty array `duplicateEntry`
1. We iterate over characters `char` of given string `str`
1. In each iteration, we check if the current character `char` is present in the `duplicateEntry`
1. If it is present then we return that current character `char`. That's our first duplicate character in given string `str`
1. If not then we add that current character `char` in `duplicateEntry` array
1. If we don't find any duplicate character in `duplicateEntry` array then we return `null`

That's it. Simple.
