### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Find-two-numbers-that-sum-up-to-0/discuss/811

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findTwo(arr) {

  // Logic: Only two equal numbers which have opposite sign can sum up to 0

  const hashTable = new Map(); // keep track of numbers, keeping positive ones

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // iterate over array `arr`
    const currentNumber = Math.abs(arr[i]); // we don't care of sign, we want to know if that number exist in our table
    if(hashTable.has(currentNumber)) { // if it exist then return previous number's index and current number's index
      return [i, hashTable.get(currentNumber)];
    }
    hashTable.set(currentNumber, i); // else set positive number with its index
  }

  return null; // if nothing found then return `null`

}
```

### Short story
After a few minutes of looking at the problem, I found the logic. <br />
Though, I usually checke other solutions after solving the problem. This practice helps me to - 

1. See if there is any optimization I can incorporate in my solution (I did, I started storing the index in the hash table)
1. What are other methods people are trying out to solve the problem

### Algorithm
Only two equal numbers with opposite signs can sum up to 0.

1. You iterate over the array
1. Push the element into a hash table (plain JS object) if it doesn't exist (with a positive sign only)
1. If it exists then we found our element that sums up to 0 

### Code overview
1. We create a hash table using `Map` to store numbers to identify pair that sums up to 0
1. We iterate over input array `arr` to find out those two equal numbers (one with opposite sign)
1. We use `Math.abs` to remove `-` from numbers before proceeding further
    1. We do this so that we can store number (whether we first encounter positive or negative of that number)
1. We check in hash table `hashTable` if the current number is already present
    1. If already present that means we have captured its index and then we return that index and current index
1. If the current number absent then we update the hash table with it along with its current index
1. If nothing found then we return `null`
