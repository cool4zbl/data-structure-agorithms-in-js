### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Find-the-largest-difference/discuss/651

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
function largestDiff(arr) {

  if(!arr.length) return 0; // if empty array then return 0

  const sortedArr = arr.sort((a, b) => b - a); // sort array in ascending order 
  return Math.abs(sortedArr[sortedArr.length -1] - sortedArr[0]); // substract last and first value to get largest diff.
}
```

### Short story
This was pretty straightforward. 
Though, I see a few people have shared [different solutions](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/Find-the-largest-difference/discuss) and it is interesting to understand them.

### Algorithm
1. You sort the array in ascending order
1. You take difference by subtracting them, though the order doesn't matter
1. As we will use `Math.abs` that will remove the significance of the order in which we subtract

### Code overview
1. We cover an edge case where array `arr` is empty
1. We sort the array in ascending order `(b - a)` as a comparator
1. We take the difference by subtracting the last `sortedArr[sortedArr.length -1]` and first element of array `sortedArr[0]`
1. We apply `Math.abs` on them to get the largest difference
