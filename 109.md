### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Math-pow/discuss/715

```js
/**
 * @param {number} base
 * @param {number} power - integer
 * @return {number}
 */
function pow(base, power){

  // base cases
  if (power == 0) return 1;
  if (power == 1) return base;

  // need to know if negative power, we need to invertly call `pow` if negative
  const isNegativePower = power < 0;

  // divide power in half and recursively call `pow`.
  // check this for better understanding - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Math-pow/discuss/192
  const divide = Math.floor(power / 2);
  const result = isNegativePower ? (1 / pow(base, -divide)) : pow(base, divide);

  // if power is odd then multiply by `base`
  return power % 2 == 0 ? result * result : result * result * base;

}
```

### Short story
I have explored a few videos to know how to get base to exponent power. In one of the videos, the instructor has divided the given base and exponent into multiple small 
bases to exponent power. I thought there will be a more optimized way but then ended up with this solution inspired by [sonpos](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-Math-pow/discuss/192).

### Algorithm
1. We distinguish between negative and positive power.
1. We recursively call function until they reach terminator condition 0 or 1
1. In each recursion call, we divide power by half 
    1. If it is negative power then we invert it and make the call
1. If the power is odd then multiply by the `base` with `result * result` else multiply only `result * result`

Time complexity: O(logn)

### Code overview
1. As we are using recursion, we need at least one base case
1. We define two base cases, if
    1. If `power == 0` then return `0`
    1. If `power == 1` then return `1`
1. We check if power is negative, ` power < 0`
1. We divide the power and recursively call the `pow` function
    1. If power is negative then we invertedly call `pow` function
1. If power is odd (after diving in half) then we multiply `base` with `result * result`
1. The last line itself will return the result
