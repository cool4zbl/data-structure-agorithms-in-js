### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/A-number-sequence%20/discuss/360


```js
/**
 * @param {number} n - integer
 * @returns {string}
 */
function getNthNum(n) {

  let result = '1';
  if (n <= 1) return result; // if input is 1 then return 1;

  while (n >= 2) { // loop over when n >=2, we covered n=1 case above

    // this is used to construct string in each iteration, detailed explanation on GitHub
    let str = '';
    let count = 1; // to count if same char repeated subsequently

    for (let i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {

      if (result.charAt(i) == result.charAt(i + 1)) { // if current char and next char is equal then increment counter
        count++;
      } else {
        str = str + count + result.charAt(i); // else construct string
        count = 1;
      }

    }

    result = str; // update result with constructed string
    n--;
  }

  return result;
}
```

### Short story
I thought I would complete this problem quickly. I had the algorithm ready but translating into code that works on the first attempt is still a dream. I had to scratch my head to fix a few issues here and there.


Though pretty happy as I now moved to a level where I now need to build my own solutions (no need to check others' solutions). <br>
One more interesting thing, developers who have submitted the solution have a more or less similar solution.

Seems like the above solution is something we get as a first impression. The human mind, incredible! ðŸ§ 

### Algorithm - 

Say, we want to find the 5th number sequence. <br>
We will have input `n=5` and intial output value `result = '1'`.


1. Iterate over a string `result` till the `result.length` while `n <= 2` 
1. Initialize string `str` with empty string value for each pass (n, n -1, n-2, etc.)
1. Initialize counter `count` with initial value `1`
1. If current char `str[i]` == `str[i+1]` then increment counter `count`
1. Else construct string using `count + str.charAt(i)`
  1. Reset counter `count` here, so that other char in `result` can utilize it for the same
1. Copy final `str` in `result`
1. Decrement `n`, `n--`
1. Return `result` once `n<=2` satisfied

Doesn't making sense? May be code overview can help.

### Code overview - 
1. We first initialize the `result` variable with value `1`. <br>
  Why? We need one base value from where we can construct a sequence. Also, if `n=1` then we can immediately return `1`.
1. As we need to find the sequence of input `n`, we need to iterate `n-1` times <br>
  Why `n-1` times and why not `n`? We already defined `n=1` value as `result=1` that's why we will iterate over `n-1` values. <br>
  We will go from `n` to `n<=2` as the sequence starts from 1 and we already defined `n=1`.
1. For each while-loop pass, we defined `str=''` and `count=1`. <br>
  We construct a sequence in each pass based on the previous `result` string. Also, we want to count how many chars are repeated adjacent to each other that's why `count`.
1. We iterate till `result.length`
  1. If we find the current char and next char equal then we increment the counter
  1. Else we know that there is no next equal char so we add that in our `str` and reset `count` so that other chars in `result` can do the same thing
1. Once we are done with for-loop then we update the `result` with `str` and decrement `n`.
1. We return the `result` when the while-loop condition met i.e. when we reach `n=1`
