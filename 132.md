### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/the-angle-between-hour-hand-and-minute-hand-of-a-clock/discuss/716

```js
/**
 * @param {string} time
 * @returns {number} 
 */
function angle(time) {

  const [hours, mins] = time.split(":");
  
  const hoursAngle = (360 / 12) * (hours % 12);
  const minutesAngle = (360 / 60) * mins;
  const surpassAngle = mins / 2;
  
  const angleBetween = Math.abs((hoursAngle + surpassAngle) - minutesAngle);
  
  const result = angleBetween > 180 ? 360 - angleBetween : angleBetween;
  return Math.round(result);
}
```

### Short story
This was pretty straightforward, I thought in the beginning.. <br/>
I missed the `surpassAngle` factor in my solution. I recalled my memory (it was a math problem in school) and made another successful attempt.


### Code overview
1. We first extract out `hours` and `mins` from `time` string using de-structuring and `split` function
1. We find the angle of given `hours` by below formula - 
    1. We first need to know what is the value of each hour
    1. We divide 360° (entire circle of round clock) by 12 to get value of each hour (360° / 12) = 30°
    1. As we might get `hours` in 24 formats (14, 18, 22, etc.) we use modulus to contain it to between 0-12 hours. Example: 14/12 = 2. Isn't it clever?
    1. We multiply Point ii and Point iii to obtain the angle of given `hours`
1. As this is time, we won't get a minute's value greater than 59. So to get the angle for given `mins` we apply the same formula -
    1. We first need to know what is the value of each minute
    1. We divide 360° (entire circle of round clock) by 60 to get value of each minute (360° / 60) = 6°
    1. We multiply value obtained from Point ii with given `mins`
1. We also need to find that extra angle that is added due to `mins` in `hours`. When we say the clock is at 12: 15 that doesn't mean the `hours` angle is at 0. <br />
Because the angle between 12 and 1 is 30° but minutes have already at 15. So we need to add that extra angle to get an accurate `hours` angle.
1. We use the below formula to get `surpassAngle` or extra angle - 
    1. If `hours` angle move 30° in 60 minutes then how many degrees in 1 minute. 
    1. We can use cross multiplication to derive it, say `x` degree it will move in 1 minute. 
    1. x => 1, 30° => 60
    1. So it will move 1/2° in one minute, so in 15 minutes it will move to 7.5°. So angle in 12:15 is 7.5° and not 0
1. That's why `surpassAngle` is given `mins` by 2
1. So the angle between `hours` and `mins` is `hoursAngle + surpassAngle) - minutesAngle`
1. We use `Math.abs` so that we get a positive value, this is required so that we can return the smaller angle.
1. To get the smaller angle we need to see if `angleBetween` is greater than 180. Because till 180 deg. angles are equal in the clockwise and anti-clockwise direction.
1. As we need to return the rounded integer, we use `Math.round` to return result.
