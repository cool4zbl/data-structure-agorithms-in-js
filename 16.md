```js
class EventEmitter {

  constructor() {
    // store all the events with their count.
    // sample structure: {eventName1: {callback1, 2}, eventName2: {callback2, 5}...}
    this.subscriptionList = {};
  }

  subscribe(eventName, callback) {

    let count = 1; // instead of duplicating callbacks, I'm using counter.
    if (!this.subscriptionList[eventName]) { // if it is first event in our collection then add it
      this.subscriptionList[eventName] = {
        callback,
        count
      };
    } else {
      this.subscriptionList[eventName] = { // if the same event is already there then increment count
        callback,
        count: ++count
      };
    }
    return {
      release: () => { // also return a method to delete event from collection, if it exist and count is > 0
        if (this.subscriptionList[eventName] && this.subscriptionList[eventName].count > 0) {
          delete this.subscriptionList[eventName];
        }

      }
    }
  }

  emit(eventName, ...args) {
    if (this.subscriptionList[eventName]) { // emit will work only if we have subscribed to event
      let count = this.subscriptionList[eventName].count;
      while (count > 0) { // invoke callback till we don't have any
        this.subscriptionList[eventName].callback(...args);
        count--;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Short story
This question came in my research too on Facebook interviews. Seems like their favorite one. <br />
Until I checked the example I thought it was difficult. I solved it using the traditional way but there are some good solutions where developers have used `Map()`.

Now I'm really interested in using `Map()` in my daily coding work.


### Code overview - 
1. We have a class `EventEmitter` with two methods `subscribe` and `emit`.
1. The consumer of this class will first subscribe to events with their callbacks and then use the `emit` method to invoke callbacks.
1. Let's work on the `subscribe` method first - 
    1. We need to add all subscribe events in a collection.
    1. I used traditional Object data structure but I believe [better to use a `new Map()`](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Event-Emitter/discuss/10) here.
    1. Note that we need to take care of the case where some callbacks could subscribe to the same event multiple times
    1. So we will attach `count` property with each event
    1. Okay, now we know our data structure which is simple object: `{eventName1: {callback1, 2}, eventName2: {callback2, 5}...}`
    1. Let's add an event when `subscribe` is called in our collection
    1. We first check if the event already exists then we just increment its count property else we add a new entry in the object
1. We also need to return the `release` method for each subscribed event.
    1. Here also we simply return an object with a `release` method attached to it, you may want to [create a separate `Subscribe` class](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-an-Event-Emitter/discuss/66) for more clear code
    1. If an event exists in our collection and count is > 0 then we remove the event from our collection
1. Let's work on the `emit` method now - 
    1. Emit's job is to invoke the callback(s)
    1. So we first need to check if that event is available in our collection or not
    1. If it exists then we simply run a while-loop to run callbacks till `count > 0` and decrement count in each iteration
    
That's all for this solution, feel free to leave a comment or send PR to improve it. ðŸ™‚
