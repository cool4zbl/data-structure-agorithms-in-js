### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-simple-store-for-DOM-node/discuss/551

```js
class NodeStore {

  constructor() {
    this.collection = {}; // keep all the nodes in object (for easy access and keeping time complexity in mind O(1))
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @param {any} value
   */
  set(node, value) {
    node.__id__ = Symbol(); // to store same elements multiple times with uniqueness (as different nodes can have different data)
    this.collection[node.__id__] = value;
  }
  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {any}
   */
  get(node) {
    return this.collection[node.__id__]; // as we modified the node, we can check its id
  }

  /**
   * @param {Node} node
   * @return {Boolean}
   */
  has(node) {
    return !!this.collection[node.__id__]; // coerce to boolean value
  }
}
```

### Short story
Seemed a lightweight problem and solved it. Though, when I was checking other people's solutions I realized that I missed a case. <br />
You can have multiple same nodes but different values for each one. Now it became interesting to find how to make a node (or any value) unique!

I checked that few people used `Math.random`, `performance.now()` or `Date` or a combination of it. It was interesting to see that few people even used `Symbol`. 
I have used `Symbol` in my code but you may want to see other methods as well. 


### Code overview
As this is some form of ES6 `Map`, we need a data structure to hold key-value pairs. 
An object is a better choice here as we don't need iteration to find the value of a key.

1. We create  `this.collection` in the constructor for holding key-value pairs. `O(1)` time complexity.
1. As Map has 3 main methods, we have here 3 methods viz. `add`, `get`, and `has`.
1. The `set` method takes a key and value to store. As we can have the same node as key for different values, we need to make these nodes uniquely identifiable. 
    1. We attach a property `__id__` (ugly naming to avoid collision) whose value is `Symbol` (a primitive value, always unique)
    1. We simply save value against node id
1. `get` and `has` is almost similar. The `get` method returns either value or `undefined` whereas `has` will coerce them to boolean (if `has` value then true else false).

That's pretty much.
