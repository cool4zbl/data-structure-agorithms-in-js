### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/find-corresponding-node-in-two-identical-DOM-tree/discuss/581

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement} rootA
 * @param {HTMLElement} rootB - rootA and rootB are clone of each other
 * @param {HTMLElement} nodeA
 */
const findCorrespondingNode = (rootA, rootB, target) => {

  // we can track 'target' in rootB using indexes stored during tracing 'target' in rootA
  let path = [];

  // 
  const getRootAPath = (rootA, target) => {
    if (rootA === target) return rootA; // if 'target' is itself rootA then directly return rootA, this will make 'path' array empty, and it will return rootB in reduceRight
    let node = target;

    while (node.parentNode) { // we will iterate till we reach top of the DOM tree
      const children = Array.from(node.parentNode.children); // convert HTMLCollection into Array
      path.push(children.indexOf(node)); // push index where 'node' found
      node = node.parentNode; // this will make sure we move from down to top
    }
  }

  getRootAPath(rootA, target);

  // reduceRight is same as reduce but it iterate values from right to left
  return path.reduceRight((acc, index) => {
    return acc.children[index];
  }, rootB)
}
```

### Short story
The question itself was not clear to me. I tried hard but then eventually needed to check solutions. <br/>
I understood the question and then tried to solve it by taking inspiration from a solution.

After completing that solution, I thought to try using recursion. I almost solved it but needed to check the solution again.  <br/>
It would have been better to solve at least recursion without taking inspiration from the existing solution.

Hope to learn more and solve problems by myself.

### Algorithm
1. We take the `target` node and get its `parentNode`
1. We check the `target` node index in the children of its `parentNode` 
1. We push that index in the `path` array
1. We re-assign `target` as its `parentNode` and keep on repeating the above steps till `target.parentNode` is `undefined`
1. We take the `path` array and iterate it from right to left to search for a node in another DOM tree

### Code overview
1. We define a `path` array to store the path we visited from the `target` node to its topmost parent node.
1. We declare the `getRootAPath` function which takes the `rootA` node and the `target` node.
1. If `rootA` and `target` are the same then we return `rootA`. Why?
    1. There is no point to run while-loop when we know that both the nodes are the same and it won't even go inside the loop.
1. We declare a variable `node` and define it with the `target`.
1. We run a while-loop till we reach to topmost parent node from the `target` node.
    1. For this, we keep modifying the `node` with the successive parent node
    1. We check the index position of the `node` in children of `node` parent
    1. We push that index in the `path` array we created earlier
    1. After this, we update `node` value with `node.parentNode`
    1. We do this until there is no more `node.parentNode` available
1. At this point, we have a `path` array containing the position of the `target` node in `rootA` and `rootB` (clone of `rootA`).
1. As we pushed indexes from bottom to top, we need to run a loop in the reverse direction.
1. We use [`reduceRight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/ReduceRight) for this use case,  it iterates items in an array from right to left
1. We iterate over position till we reach to the target in `rootB`.
1. We return the target node once we reach the node in the `rootB`.

That's all, folks.
