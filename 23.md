### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/create-a-sum/discuss/145

```js
/**
 * @param {number} num
 */
function sum(num) {
  const func = function(num2) { // #4
    return num2 ? sum(num+num2) : num; // #3
  }

  func.valueOf = () => num; // #2
  return func; // #1
}
```

### Short story
This was asked in one of the FAANG company. I understood the recursion part but it was difficult for me to digest the `valueOf` part. </br>
I spent 2-3 days and finally understood the role of `valueOf` here. You will appreciate the question and understand the JS basic when you read the explanation below. 


### Algorithm
1. If `num2` exist then add `num + num2` and call `sum` with it
1. If there is no `num2` (we hit the last parenthesis) then simply return `num` (as we keep adding `num + num2` to make num) we have the final value as `num`
1. We customize the native `valueOf` function and make sure we return `num` when it is called after JS type coercion
1. We return function definition at the end


### Code overview

We know that `sum(1)(2)` can be done by returning a function from a function. Example:
```
function sum(num) {
  return function(num2) {
    return num+num2;
  }
}
```

but we can have `sum(1)(2)....(n)` up to `n`.

How do we solve such problems? We first see a pattern, the pattern is that we need to return function `n` times.
When we see a pattern then we can write concise code using recursion. <br />

So I solved this problem using recursion. But before that let's demystify these 8 lines of code. <br />

#1: Why do we need to use `func` variable, why can't we just directly return `function(num2)...` (#4)? <br />

Because we are comparing non-primitive (Object, functions are Objects in JS) value against a primitive value (Number). <br />
`sum(1)(2)(3) == 6`

When we do such comparisons then JS has to do "type coercion". How does JS do this?

It has `valueOf` and `toString` to do that. Essentially, one of them will be called. 
What we do here is that we override that method and tell the JS engine to return our custom value (which is `num`) in our case.
That's why we needed to store #4 in a variable so that we can override the `valueOf` method.

#2: Okay, I get it that you wanted to use the `valueOf` method, but why do you on this beautiful earth want to do that? 
Because if `sum(1)(2)` will return us another function and we can't compare below -

`function(num2) { return num2 ? sum(num+num2) : num }  == 3`

So what we do is we tell the JS engine to use our `valueOf` method to return value, which is 'num'.
So we can now compare `3 == 3`

#3: Okay, then why do we have ternary on #3?
Because in case you want to use call `sum` function normally and get value out of it.
`sum(1)(2)()` will return 3
