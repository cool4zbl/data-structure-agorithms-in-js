### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/reorder-array-with-new-indexes/discuss/285



```js
/**
 * @param {any[]} items
 * @param {number[]} newOrder
 * @return {void}
 */
function sort(items, newOrder) {
  const copiedItems = [...items]; // copy 'items' array so that we don't mess accessing elements from 'items' in loop.

  /** 
  fairly simple, you iterate and take the index value from B[i] and put A[i] 
  Example i =0 so B[0] will be '1' so we need to put A[0] that is 'A' at 1st position in array A
  **/
  for (let i = 0; i < newOrder.length; i++) {
    items[newOrder[i]] = copiedItems[i];
  }
}
```


| Assume   | as |
|----------|---|
| `items` | Array A |
| `newOrder` | Array B |

### Short story
It took a few minutes to understand the problem. I initially figured out the problem using the sample example and then finally understood by reading it again. 
I missed reading the problem and I was returning the result. The problem says you need to modify the input array.

Also, JSDoc says it returns void. 🤦‍♂️
I want to practice reading problems thoroughly and take a few minutes to understand the requirements clearly.


### Algorithm - 
1. Create a new copy of the array to avoid mess up when you want to access elements from the original array
1. Loop over `newOrder` or `items` (assuming both must be equal)
1. Access B's index by `newOrder[i]` and put `items[i]` in that position in the `items` array

| Time complexity | Space complexity |
|-----------------|------------------|
| O(n)            | O(n)             |
