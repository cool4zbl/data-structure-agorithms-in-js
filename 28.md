### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-clearAllTimeout/discuss/460


```js
/**
 * cancel all timer from window.setTimeout
 */
function clearAllTimeout() {
  for (let id in collection) {
    clearTimeout(collection[id]); // remove one timer at a time
  }
  collection = []; // empty global list once we clear all the timers
}

window.collection = []; // store timer id in the global object (of course, name should be unique enough)

const originalSetTimeout = window.setTimeout; // keep the copy of original implementation, as we are modifying it

window.setTimeout = (handler, timeInMs, ...rest) => {
  const id = originalSetTimeout(handler, timeInMs, ...rest); // 1
  collection.push(id); // push timer id in the list so that we can remove them using clearAllTimeout function
  return id; // setTimeout/setInterval always return an id
}
```

### Short story
I somewhere read about this. All the timers return an id. The ids value is usually in incremental order and it is on user agents (browsers) to define
logic for generating ids. If we want to clear a timer then we need to use either `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()` because user agents keep the active timers in a single list shared among both timeout and interval methods.


### Code overview
Before I give a tour of code, we need to understand a few things.

Each timer has its own id and that id is required to clear the timer. If we want to clear all timers then we need to store these ids somewhere.
We can keep them in the global list and use it in the `clearAllTimeout` function.

We need to change the implementation of `window.setTimeout` so that we can push ids in the global list.

1. Let's change the implementation of `window.setTimeout`
    1. Whenever we change the implementation of native functionality, we need to keep a copy in case we need to use it
    1. We keep the original functionality in a variable `const originalSetTimeout = window.setTimeout;`
    1. We override `window.setTimout`; `window.setTimeout = <Custom Implementation>`
    1. We call original `setTimeout` with arguments we get and store its id in global list (Line 1 in the `window.setTimeout` function)
    1. We return `id` as it is part of `setTimeout` implementation
1. We create a global list, it can be anything from Object to Map but for simplicity, I used an array
1. At last, we have the `clearAllTimeout` function whose job to iterate over ids in the global list and clear them using `clearTimeout`
    1. Once everything is clear then we flush our global list
