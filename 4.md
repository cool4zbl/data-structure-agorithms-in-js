### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-basic-throttle/discuss/774

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {number} wait
 */
function throttle(func, wait) {

  let timer = null;
  let lastArgs = null;

  return function throttled(...args) {

    if(!timer) { // initially it will be null and we will call func.apply
      func.apply(this, args);
      timer = setTimeout(() => {
        if(lastArgs) { // initially it is null, so no execution
          func.apply(this, lastArgs);
          lastArgs = null;
        }
        timer = null; // though it will start accepting function but only after `wait` is over
      }, wait)
    } else { // till then it will keep discarding function calls made within `wait` period
      lastArgs = args;
      return;
    }
  }

}
```

### Short story
I have solved this problem in past but this time I had to check solutions.
I understood each line and found that if it will print the last call twice if a new function call is made after waiting period `wait`.


### Algorithm
1. We keep 2 variables to track `setTimeout` and the last function's call arguments
1. If we are calling the first time or after `wait` then we will call the function `func` with passed arguments
    1. We will make the next call (with last call arguments) after the `wait` is over with `setTimeout`
    1. We will reset `setTimeout` and last call arguments
1. If we get function calls before `wait` then we keep replacing it in our tracker variable `lastArgs`


### Code overview
1. We declare and initially define 2 variables with `null` viz. `timer` and `lastArgs`
1. The `timer` is used to track whether `setTimeout` is over and we can enable calling the function `func`
1. The `lastArgs` holds arguments for the last call and if you make multiple then it will replace and keep only the last one
1. In the outer function, we take the function `func` to call and a `wait` time. This is a pretty standard structure for [throttling utility](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#throttle).
1. We return a throttled function that can take arguments to pass to the function to be called.
1. We check if the `timer` is `null`. This can happen in 2 cases -
    1. This is the first time we are calling throttled function or
    1. The `wait` time passed and the calling function is enabled
1. We call function `func` with arguments passed to throttled function
1. We use `setTimeout` to make the next function after the `wait` time. We check if we had the last function calls where we update `lastArgs`. Initially, the `lastArgs` will be
`null` so no execution.
1. If function calls are made when the `wait` is still in effect then we simply add the last function's arguments in `lastArgs`. In this way, old calls will get discarded and 
we will have only arguments from the very last call.
1. If the `wait` is over and we have `lastArgs` then we would call function `func` with `lastArgs` after `wait` time and reset tracking variables to `null` again.

That's it for the explanation.
