### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/search-first-index-with-Binary-Search-duplicate-array/discuss/670

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr - ascending array with duplicates
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
function firstIndex(arr, target){

  let min = 0;
  let max = arr.length;
  let result = -1;

  while(min <= max) {

    let mid = Math.floor((min + max) / 2);

    if(arr[mid-1] < target) {
      min = mid + 1;
    } else {
      if(arr[mid-1] == target) result = mid-1;
      max = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

### Short story
Seems like now I like binary search. <br />
Whenever I see a sorted array and need to find something, by default I get Binary Search as a primary algorithm to solve the problem.

### Algorithm (Binary Search)
1. You have a collection of sorted items in a `arr`.
1. You define `min` and `max` variables. `min = 0`, `max = arr.length`.
1. You take middle value. `mid = (min + max) / 2`.
1. You put a condition and move either in the left direction or right direction of the middle. `min = mid + 1` or `max = mid - 1`.
1. As we need to find the first index and we are shrinking `max` when the condition is true, we keep replacing it in `result` variable till `arr[mid-1] < target` is false.
1. We continue this until `min <=max`. This is the terminator condition for the loop. This is because when you move in any direction either `min` will go beyond `max` value 
or `max` will go below `min` and this will terminate the loop.
1. Once we reach the terminator condition, we return the `result`.


### Code overview
1. We declare and define `min`, `max`, and `result` variable.
2. We initialize `min` and `max` values as per the Binary Search algorithm and initialize result with -1. In case, we don't have `target` in the array then we return it.
3. We iterate till we exhaust our search in either direction by using condition `min <= max`
4. We take `mid` by dividing the `min` and `max`. For the first iteration, it will be always middle of the `arr` (of course Math.floor plays a role)
5. If the `mid < target` in the `arr` then reduce `max` value and if `arr` middle value is equal to `target` then we update `result` with it.
6. We keep doing this until the while-loop is terminated.
7. At the end, we either get the first index or -1
