### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-throttle-with-leading-and-trailing-option/discuss/783

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {number} wait
 * @param {boolean} option.leading
 * @param {boolean} option.trailing
 */
function throttle(func, wait, option = {leading: true, trailing: true}) {

  // if both are false then do no thing
  if(!option.leading && !option.trailing) {
    return () => null;
  }

  let timer = null;
  let lastArgs = null;
  let lastContext = null;

  return function throttled(...args) {

    // firs time `timer` will be null
    // subsequently, it will just store last function's data
    if(timer) {
      lastArgs = args;
      lastContext = this;
      return;
    } else {
      // whenn `timer` is null and if `leading` is true then invoke function.
      // else don't do anything.
      if(option.leading) {
        func.apply(this, args);
      }
    }

    const timeup = () => {
      // if `trailing` is false then it won't run last function ever
      // if you subsequently call function within `wait`

      // if `trailing` is true and you call function within `wait` then it will invoke here
      if (option.trailing && lastArgs) {
        func.apply(lastContext, lastArgs);
        lastContext = null;
        lastArgs = null;
        // works only if you have called or stored last function call
        timer = setTimeout(timeup, wait);
      } else {
        timer = null;
      }
    }

     timer = setTimeout(timeup, wait);
  }
}
```

### Short story
This is an extended version of [4. implement basic throttle()](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/data-structure-agorithms-in-js/blob/master/4.md). 
I tried my solution but 2 test cases were failing. It was difficult to understand the solution too. Though, finally understood, and here is my explanation.


### Algorithm/Code overview

The algorithm shares similarity with [4. implement basic throttle()](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/data-structure-agorithms-in-js/blob/master/4.md#algorithm). 
I would recommend you go through the basic version first before understanding this one.

1. If `leading` and `trailing` are `false` then we don't do anything. We simply return `null`.
There is nothing we can do if both are `false`, that's why we have `true` as their initial values.
1. We keep 3 variables to track `setTimeout`, the last function's call arguments `lastArgs`, and keeping last call's context in `lastContext` (seems like optional though)
1. If the `timer` is `null` (first-time call or `wait` time has passed) then -
    1. We call the function `func` with passed arguments if `leading` is `true`
    1. Else there is nothing to do here because `leading` is `false` and we collapse that call
1. Else we keep replacing values in tracker variables `lastArgs` and `lastContext` and terminate further program execution.
    1. So that we don't make `setTimeout` call until the `timer` is `null`.  
1. When the `timer` is `null` then we will continue and invoke the `timeup` function with the `wait` - 
    1. This `timeup` function will check if `trailing` is `true` (we want to invoke last calls)
    1. We have called throttle within `wait` so we have `largeArgs`
1. If both the above condition is `true` then we will invoke `func` with supplied `lastArgs`.
1. If anyone of the condition is `false` then we will make `timer = null` so that after the `wait` we can invoke `func` if `leading` is `true`.
1. Again to Point #5, after invoking `func` it will reset `lastContext` and `lastArgs`. 
1. After that, we will again call `setTimeout` with `timeup` and `wait`.
    1. In between, if there is `lastArgs` then we will call `func` else we will set `timer = null` and life will begin from the `throttle`.

I'm excited to improve the solution and code walkthrough. Feel free to drop a comment, or send a PR or send memes [@knowkalpesh](https://twitter.com/knowkalpesh).
