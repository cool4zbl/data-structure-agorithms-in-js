### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/get-DOM-tree-height/discuss/618

```js
/**
 * @param {HTMLElement | null} tree
 * @return {number}
 */
function getHeight(tree) {

  const counter = []; // keep total counts of each top level child

  if (!tree) return 0;
  const children = tree.children;
  if (children.length == 0) return 1;

  function calcHeight(node) { // calculate height of each top level child node

    const children = node.children;

    if (children.length == 0) return 1; // terminator condition to stop recursion

    let count = 1; // initialse with 1 as we need to count its parent too
    for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
      count += calcHeight(children[i]); // keep on adding until 0 child 
    }
    return count; // return total count
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) { // iterate top level children
    counter.push(calcHeight(children[i])); // get total counts of each top level children
  }

  const result = counter.sort(); // sort counts in ascending order
  return result[result.length - 1] + 1; // add 1 because we need to count root node too
}
```

### Short story
Before this problem, I solved [#19](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/BFEDevSolutions/blob/master/19.md). 
I needed to check the solution for that problem and decided to solve this similar problem by myself.

I tried in the last 2 days to solve this simple problem and then eventually came up with my solution (there are far [better solutions](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/get-DOM-tree-height/discuss) than this). 
Pretty satisfied with it.


### Algorithm
1. Loop over top-level children and get their height
1. Store these heights in an array
1. In the end, sort the array in ascending order
1. Take out the largest number and add 1 (to count root in its height)


### Code overview
1. We initialize the `counter` array to store heights of each top-level nodes
1. If the tree is empty/falsy then we simply return height `0`
1. We declare `children` variable and store top-level  children
1. If the root node has no children then we simply return `1`
1. We iterate over `children` (top-level  children) and call the `calcHeight` function
1. Inside `calcHeight` function
    1. Here again, we store children of that node in the `children` variable
    1. If there are no children for a node then we simply return `1` which acts as terminator condition for recursion call to `calcHeight`
    1. We define and declare `count` variable with 1 (we need to consider its parent too in the height)
    1. We loop over children of the node recursively and keep adding that until we reach terminator condition
    1. We came out of the loop and return the final count
1. We store total counts in the `counter` array
1. We finally sort the array in ascending order to get its largest number
1. We need to count root in its height so we add `1` in the largest number and return it


That's all, folks.
