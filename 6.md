### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-basic-debounce/discuss/1072

```js

/**
 * @param {Function} func
 * @param {number} wait
 */
function debounce(func, wait) {

  // definition: invoke function only when the last function has passed `wait` time

  let timerId = null;
  return function debounced(...args) {

    // clear timer (doesn't matter if the execution is going or has completed)
    // 1. nothing will happen in the case when execution has completed
    // 2. it will clear the timer and restart if an ongoing timer was running
    clearTimeout(timerId);

    // call supplied function `func` after `wait` time
    timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, wait);
  }

}
```

### Short story
This sort of problem always trips me. You need to first understand the definition and keep it in mind while writing the program. I added links in the [Resources](#resources) section 
that helped me in getting clarity about debouce. It is difficult to not get tempted to check others' solutions (I even controlled temptation for 3 days in the past). 
The DSA is a good opportunity to learn this skill too.

This is a basic debounce version but you may want to checkout [Lodash's debouce](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)
which has `cancel`, `flush`, and other useful features.

### Code overview
1. We first begin by declaring a `timerId` and define it with `null`. We need this variable because we want to cancel the timer if the user has invoked the function within `wait` time.
1. We return a function `debounced` to collect arguments. This is a standard practice of debouncing and throttling where you return a function. <br />
```
function hello(name) { console.log("Hello" + name); }

const debounced = debounce(hello, 250);
```
3. We clear the timer using `clearTimeout`, there can be 2 cases here - 
    1. The user has invoked the function again within the `wait` time, in this case, we will reset the timer
    1. User has invoked function after `wait` time, in this case, nothing will reset and function is safe to run again
    1. You can omit 2nd case by using the `if(timerId)` condition
4. After this, we assign a `setTimeout` in `timerId` because - 
    1. `setTimeout` will return an id that can be used to reset the timer if the function invoked again within the `wait` time. See 3.i
5. In `setTimeout`, we call the supplied function
6. This will make sure that function `func` always gets called after the `wait` time
