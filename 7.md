### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/implement-debounce-with-leading-and-trailing-option/discuss/1076

```js
/**
   * @param {Function} func
   * @param {number} wait
   * @param {boolean} option.leading
   * @param {boolean} option.trailing
   */
function debounce(func, wait, option = {leading: false, trailing: true}) {

  // in basic debounce, we kept only timerId
  // here, we will keep lastArgs too as we trailing function call with last arguments
  let timerId = null;
  let lastArgs = null;

  // if both leading and trailing are false then do nothing.
  if(!option.leading && !option.trailing) return () => null;

  return function debounced(...args) {

    // if timer is over and leading is true
    // then immediately call supplied function
    // else capture arguments in lastArgs
    if(!timerId && option.leading) {
      func.apply(this, args);
    } else {
      lastArgs = args;
    }

    // clear timer so that next call is exactly after `wait` time
    clearTimeout(timerId);

    timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      // invoke only if lastArgs is present and trailing is true
      if(option.trailing && lastArgs) func.apply(this, lastArgs); 

      // reset variables as they need to restart new life after calling this function 
      lastArgs = null;
      timerId = null;
    }, wait);
  }
}
```

### Short story
This is more or less the same as implementing throttle with leading and trailing options. I have solved this along with [6. implement basic debounce()](https://github.com/kalpeshsingh/data-structure-agorithms-in-js/blob/master/6.md). 

### Code overview
1. We first begin by declaring a `timerId` and define it with `null`. We need this variable because we want to cancel the timer if the user has invoked the function within `wait` time.
1. We also define and declare `lastArgs = null`. We need to call function `func` with the last arguments when the `trailing` option is true.
1. If both the options `leading` and `trailing` are false then we return a noop function.
1. We return a function `debounced` to collect arguments. This is a standard practice of debouncing and throttling where you return a function. <br />
```
function hello(name) { console.log("Hello" + name); }

const debounced = debounce(hello, 250);
```
3. Here, the `leading` option means to call the function immediately. So we check if `timerId` is `null` means we are ready to execute the function and `leading` is true then we immediately call function. 
Otherwise, we will capture the last function call's arguments.
4. We clear the timer using `clearTimeout`, there can be 2 cases here - 
    1. The user has invoked the function again within the `wait` time, in this case, we will reset the timer
    1. User has invoked function after `wait` time, in this case, nothing will reset and function is safe to run again
    1. You can omit 2nd case by using the `if(timerId)` condition
5. After this, we assign a `setTimeout` in `timerId` because - 
    1. `setTimeout` will return an id that can be used to reset the timer if the function is invoked again within the `wait` time. See 4.i
6. In `setTimeout`, we check if `lastArgs` is present and the `trailing` option is true then call the supplied function with `lastArgs`
7. We reset `lastArgs` and `timerId` value
