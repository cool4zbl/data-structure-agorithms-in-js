### Solution

Submission link - https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/convert-snake_case-to-camelCase/discuss/916

```js
/**
 * @param {string} str
 * @return {string}
 */
function snakeToCamel(str) {

  let result = str[0]; // in any case we want to keep first char as it is

  for(let i = 1; i < str.length; i++) { // begin from i=1 as we already have 0th index char

    /** main logic:
    1. current char `i` must be '_'
    2. previous char must not be '_'
    3. next char must not be '_'
    4. current char must less than 2nd last of string
    **/
    if(str[i] == '_' && str[i-1] != '_' && str[i+1] != '_' && i < str.length - 1) {
      result += str[i+1].toUpperCase();
      i++; // increment because we already consider i+1 in previous line.
    } else {
      result += str[i]; // else just add in the result string
    }
  }
  return result; // 🍻 return the camelCase because that's the way
}
```

### Short story
In the last few weeks, I was not excited about solving problems and doing my side project. It was more like an unwanted break I took. <br />
I tried this problem first with regex and couldn't succeed but when I look at a few solutions I realized that I was near to a solution. 
It's just that I didn't work with regex before. I decided not to solve this problem with regex and better try to solve it with iteration.


### Algorithm
1. Create an empty output string and append the first char
    1. In both camel case and snake case, the first character is always a small case
    1. And it takes care of the case where the first character is `_`
1. We iterate over the input string and iteration begins at 1 because we already covered the first character above
1. We want to make the eligible character (a letter after `_`) upper case only when
    1. The current character is `_` - because we want to make its next letter upper case
    1. If the previous/next character isn't `_` - If previous/next and current character is `_` then it's a contiguous underscore and we don't want to touch it
    1. The current character index must be 2nd last character in the input string because -
        1. In both camel case and snake case, the last character is always a small case
        1. And it takes care of the case where the last character is `_`
    1. We increment the current count by 1 because we already consider the next character case
1. Otherwise, we append the current character in the output string
1. After for-loop, we return constructed string


### Code overview
1. Create an empty string `result` and add the first character
1. We iterate over input string `str` with a for-loop and begin at 1
    1. Because we already covered the first character in step 1
1. We want to make the character after `_` to upper case if - 
    1. The current character `str[i]` is `_`
    1. The previous/next character is not `_` (because that will make it contiguous underscore)
    1. The current count `i` is less than string length (2nd last character in the `str`)
    1. If these conditions are met then we make `str[i+1]` to upper case and append to the `result` string
    1. We increment `i`s value because we already covered `i+1` in the above step
1. Else we append the current character in the `result` string (because there is nothing to transform in else case)
