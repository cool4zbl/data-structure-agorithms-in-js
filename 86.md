```js
/**
 * @param {number} n - non-negative integer
 * @return {number}
 */
function fib(n, acc1 = 0, acc2 = 1) {
  console.count();
  if (n == 0) return 0;

  if (n == 1) {
    if (acc2 == 1) return 1;
    return acc2;
  }

  return fib(n - 1, acc2, acc1 + acc2);
}

```

### Short story
I have solved the problem with recursion but without tail call optimization (TCO). <br />
The solution was acceptable but it was calling `fib(8)` 67 times.

I started looking for other posted solutions and found that a [user EzrealPrince has posted](https://bigfrontend.dev/problem/fibonacci-number/discuss/246) <br />
a better solution. I checked `console.count()` and it was 8 times `fib(8)`. 

> This has taught me that when you want to reduce Space complexity or want to have proper TCO then consider function parameters (with default values) to hold calculation
for you. At least your function won't fill stack frames. 

### Algorithm - 
1. Use two additional parameters with 2 initial numbers - 0 and 1 (because Fibonacci series is:  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...)
1. Add first terminator condition `n === 0`
1. Add another terminator condition `n === 1`.
  1. If `acc2` is 1 means `fib(1)` 
  2. else `n` is reduced by recursion till `n = 1`
1. Call `fib` recursively until it meets those terminator conditions

| Time complexity<sup>*</sup> | Space complexity<sup>*</sup> |
|-----------------|------------------|
| O(1)            | O(1)             |

<sup>*</sup> = I hope this is the correct Big O values for the solution.
