There is an issue with BFE where it is detecting infinite loop for this program. <br />
Already reported to them, meanwhile, let's use gist for the explanation.



```js
/**
 * @param {string[][]} message
 * @return {string}
 */
function decode(message) {

  if (!message.length) return ''; // input: [] | output:  ""

  const decode = [message[0][0]]; // add first letter anyways, this can cover below edge cases.

  let row = 0;
  let item = 0;
  let isDown = true; // a flag to determine diagonally down or up traverse

  while (row <= message.length - 1 && item <= message[message.length - 1].length) { // we need to stop when we reach end in both diagonally down or up
    for (let i = 1; i <= message.length - 1; i++) { // a loop to traverse `message` items 

      if (isDown) { // if it is down then go down one row
        row++;
      } else {
        row--; // else go up
      }
      item++;
      decode.push(message[row][item]);
    }
    isDown = !isDown; // invert flag once we reach end in any direction
  }

  return decode.join(''); // build string out of `decode` array

}

// input: [[]] | output:  ""
// input: [["A"]] | output:  "A"
// input: [["A"],["B"]] | output:  "A"
```

### Short story
I solved the problem first on paper and then converted into code. I realized that there is still room for improvement (algorithm and aesthetic wise). <br/>
I started spotting areas and finally come up with this solution.

One of the improvement is to push `message[0][0]` as the initial value in the `decode` array. <br />
This has removed extra checks in for-loop and also covered many test cases out of the box.

Pretty happy with it though always open to improvements and suggestions.


### Algorithm - 
1. We first check if the input is a 2-D array or not. If it isn't a 2-D array then return the empty string.
1. Push first items in array `message[0][0]`.
1. After the first iteration, we can only move `message.length - 1` in any direction. That's why we begin for-loop with 1 and add the first item in `decode`. <br />
How can you be sure that we can only move `message.length - 1` in diagonal direction? It's mere observation and finding a pattern in `message` array.
1. We keep three variable viz. `row`, `item`, and `isDown`. 
1. The `row` is used to traverse arrays in the `message` and `item` is used to traverse within array items within the `message`.
1. As we need to move either diagonally down right or diagonally up right, we need to increment the `row` variable based on that.
1. As we move in the right direction that's why we increment the `item` variable in any case.
1. We need to alternatively move diagonally down or up so we will move till we move to the last row and last element. That's our while-loop condition.
1. Now using for-loop we move diagonally down or up and push items in `decode` array. We change direction after each for-loop completion.
1. Once the while-loop is ended, we simply join items from the `decode` array and build string.

### Code overview - 
1. As the problem states that if no characters could be collected, return the empty string. This can happen in two cases - 
    1. If `message` length is 0
    1. If the `message` has empty arrays in it.
    
1. We need to take care of 1st (1.i) and the 2nd case will be covered using our loops. That's why we begin our program with - </br>
`if (!message.length) return '';`
1. We put the first letter to our `decode` array. This is the point where we will start moving in a diagonal direction. This has two benefits - 
    1. It will cover cases such as returning an empty string if the input is `[[]]`
    1. As we read in the **Algorithm** section (#3) that after the first pass we can only move `message.length - 1` in up or down. <br />
    This eliminates the need for extra flags such as `isFirst` and manipulates for-loop conditions. Because in first it will move 3 times and after that only 2 times until
    it reaches to end of the `message` array.
1. Let's see why do we need 3 variables viz.  `row`, `item` and `isDown`. 
    1. We will travel diagonally, when you traverse in diagonal then we move row as well as items. That's why `row` and `item` to keep track of it.
    1. This is also needed for the termination condition for a while-loop.
    1. As we move only in the right direction that means we will always increment `item` but we need to move across row (up and down) that's why we keep `isDown` flag to change row direction (`row++` or `row--`). <br/>
    The flag is initially true because in the first pass we will move downward right direction. We change it after each for-loop completion.
    1. Okay, now we reached till while-loop and we already discussed that we will traverse until we reach the end of the `message` array that is the last element of the last row. <br />
    1. We use for-loop to traverse upward or downward based on the `isDown` flag. As we traverse, we keep pushing elements in the `decode` array.
    1. Once the while-loop is ended, we simply join items from the decode array and build string.
