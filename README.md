Hello there,

I'm excited to have you on this page. The repository files may seem intimidating but believe me if you have decided to work on your problem-solving, algorithms, and data structure then you would love to know my struggle and opinions (a short story with each problem) and solutions. ðŸ™‚

I started my journey of learning data structure, problem-solving, algorithms that are asked by many companies including FAANG. I found an interesting website called [bigfrontend.dev](https://bigfrontend.dev/) (BFE) (initial stage at the time of writing) where they have listed 125 problems to be solved in Javascript.

If you are one who never tried data structure and algorithms then let me assure you that I was like you or perhaps bad at these. I just started my journey and so far loving it. You would be surprised how much potential you have when you follow discipline and consistency in life.

I will document solutions to problems that I solved on BFE with the following structure -

- Solution link
- Solution with code comments
- Short story (who doesn't love story? ðŸ˜‰)
- Algorithm (if applicable)
- Code walkthrough (if applicable)
- Resources/credits (if any)
